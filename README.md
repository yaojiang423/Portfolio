Yao Jiang's public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Made in China, I'm Yao Jiang, a second year Arts Management graduate student from CMU, a mind embracing passion for art and inner data geek. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to design effective data visualization to make my analysis more compelling. Being an art advisory in the future, I can bring what I learn from this class into my future work to better convince my client with my professional insights.

# Portfolio
Here are my advantures on my way to explore data visualization!
## OECD Data Visualization
## [General government debt data visualization from OECD](/dataviz1.md)

## [General government debt data visualization in beeswarm plot](/dataviz2.md)
This is a beeswarm plot I created with the data on general government debt from OECD. From left to right, the dots represent the value of  debt-to-GDP ratio for each country in each year from 1996 to 2018. The larger the dot is, the higher gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP, which indicates the less likely the country will pay back its debt and the higher its risk of default.
