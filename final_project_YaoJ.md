## Outline
### Quick Summary:
Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), as one of the largest and most influential museums of modern art in the world, it has been play an important role in developing and collecting modern art from 1920s until now. Based on the data of MoMA's collection, my project will be focus on determine the trends between the artwork they collected and the nationality of the artists or artist gender or the type of artwork. Therefore, provide a new and fun way to see the trends in contemporary art history with the data.

### Project Structure
1. Introduce the background of MoMA, and give people the context about the contemporary art history.
2. Look into the trends between the artwork they collected and the nationality of the artists.
3. Look into the trends between the artwork they collected and the artist's gender.
4. Look into the trends between the artwork they collected and the type of the artwork. 
5. Discuss the trends we see through the data and the relationship with the history of contemporary art, provide some key takeaways on how to understand the contemporary art throught our findings.

## Data 
I found the collection data from MoMA's github page, which documenting their collecting records from 1920s until now with more than 26,000 objects in total. To deal with the huge dataset, I will clean the data before I using them to generate data visualization. To analyze their collecting trends, I will focus on factors as nationality, gender and type of art to see the change in the numbers of the artworks in the whole time period. Meanwhile, I will compare the trends with the trends in social-ecomoic changes to understand the contemporary art history.
The data source is from MoMA's github page https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection


##  Method and medium
In the final presentation, I will choose to use Shorthand. The storyboard platform is pretty cool, which is more functional than powerproint. With only 1 minutes to present, I think Shorthand will be a idea tool to use. 
After making sketch with hand drawing and rough data visualization made with Tableau, I will more focus on refining my hypothesis and doing research on how to interpret the trends. Due to the huge body of the dataset I will be work with, there will be a lot work in cleaning the data and organize the data for generating informative and effective charts and conveying the information more clearly.
